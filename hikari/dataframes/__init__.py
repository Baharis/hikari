"""
This module contains all dataframes utilised in hikari.
A dataframe is a low-level object, which stores and manipulates certain
crystallographic information. At the moment, the following dataframes
are implemented:

- **hkl** - for single crystal reflection data
- **cif** - for crystallographic open format data (partially)
- **res** - for shelx crystal structure data (partially)

Please mind that the `hkl` frame, HklFrame is the most developed.
Other frames are in an early stage of development.
