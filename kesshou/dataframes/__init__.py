"""
This module contains all dataframes utilised in Kesshou.
A dataframe is a low-level Kesshou object, which stores and manipulates certain
crystallographic information. At the moment, the following dataframes
are implemented:

- **hkl** - for single crystal reflection data
- **cif** - for crystallographic open format data
- **res** - for shelx crystal structure data
- **pro** - for XD property data

Please mind that the `hkl` frame, HklFrame is the most developed.
Other frames are in an early stage of development.
