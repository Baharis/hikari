This file contains a list of names for available point groups.
All point group names base on the short Hermann-Maugin notation,
but some minor diverges had to be made in order to consider the limitations
of python programming language (eg. overbar or minus could not be used).
This resulted in a "Internal notation", both human- and python- readable.
Internal notation always start from PG, which stands for Point Group;
their names use '_' instead of minus/overbar, and 'p' instead of slash.

Abbreviations used in the table:
Hermann-Maugin notation - HMNot
Schoenflies notation    - SNot
Internal notation  - INot
Asterisk (*) denotes alternative choice of axes
